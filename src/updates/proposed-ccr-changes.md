# Why Update Belmont Park Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions?

HOA's are very popular models for subdivisions in the development stages.  The average Buyer feels that they bring value to their investment.  It helps to maintain a consistent condition and feel to a subdivision that boasts pride of ownership.  Everyone knows a subdivision that was so appealing when it was newer but over time looks tired, uncared for and worn out. These subdivisions most likely don't have HOAs.  This cycle of a subdivision greatly affects the value of all the homes in that area.  HOA's are effective because they are one of the most assured ways you can protect your most valuable investment, your home.
