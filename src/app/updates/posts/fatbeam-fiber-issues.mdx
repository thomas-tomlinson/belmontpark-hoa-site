Fatbeam Fiber has been installing fiber optic cabling in the neighborhood
as you may have noticed.

# Why is some company digging up my yard?
The Ada County Highway District  is overseeing the project, which is
common as the areas in question are considered to be in ACHD's right
of way— meaning the land is not technically the homeowners' property.
If residents experience problems with Fatbeam Fiber installation such as:
- Damage to sod or flowerbeds
- Damage to sprinkler systems (even if damage isn't apparent until Spring 2025)
- Damage to driveways or sidewalks
- Damage to roadways
- Other issues with cable installation
