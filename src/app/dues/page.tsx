            <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Yearly HOA Dues</h2>
            <p>HOA dues are due March 31st of every year. Yearly HOA dues are $90.00 (effective December 4, 2025) per lot.
                This fee covers the period of January 1st through December 31st, of the year they are invoiced.
                Members receive a $10 discount (bringing the total to $80) if dues are paid by March 10.

            <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">HOA Initiation Fee (transfer fee)</h2>
            <p>The initiation fee is $400 when a home sells. This one-time, up-front fee
                (typically paid by buyers at closing) for new homeowners helps to maintain
                a positive cash flow while not negatively affecting the current homeowners
                with higher yearly HOA fees. The money is spent on various neighborhood needs
                which can include landscaping improvements, entrance maintenance, or other repairs
                and improvements. These activities increase everyone’s home values.
            </p>
            <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Payments</h2>
            <p>Annual HOA Dues and Transfer fees are set by the Belmont Park HOA board, in accordance with the bylaws.
                Invoices will be sent via email (belmontparkboisehoa@gmail.com).  Please be sure to check beginning mid-March,
                and possibly check junk mail if you do not see it in your inbox.
